**What's the result of my work for this webpage?** <BR />
Group 4 made a palette cleanser app in order to fulfill a need for variaous font colors and font types in projects. The user can 
create a login, log into the web app, select the font types and font colors they want for the header, body, and footer of their webpage.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
We learned the value of teamwork. We also learned what it's like to work in the front-end and back-end. We learned how to implement technologies 
such as Heroku, node, express, Javascript, Bootstrap, bCrypt, Sequelize, HTML, & handlebars. We had some issues with getting the database working and 
getting the fonts to work. We kept doing research and little by little overcame the obstacles and got the application to work. We also made the web app
viewable on mobile devices.
